# linear_search_vs_random_search
Compare two simple algorithms to find a randomly generated number 
Worst case algo uses linear search to check all 1000 possible choices in order  e.g. (000, 001, 002...found it!)
We can expect to find the random number in n/2 time

Random case generates a random number and compares it to the originally generated random number e.g. (373, 492...found it!)
We can expect to find the random number in n time
